<p> There are two types of communication: verbal and nonverbal communication. Verbal communication is
an exchange of spoken or written language with others during interactions. Nonverbal communication is a message transmission through non-spoken physcial and behavioral cues. It has more channels, 
is more ambiguous, has less rules, and has more meaning.About 60-93% of all interractions
cross culturally are nonverbal.
